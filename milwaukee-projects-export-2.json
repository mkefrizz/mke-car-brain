EPA Fuel Economy Database (fueleconomy.gov) - searchable, downloadable\n2. Edmunds.com Used Car Specifications - comprehensive, reliable\n3. Cars.com Historical Specs - good cross-check\n\nSecondary:\n4. Auto-data.net / automobile-catalog.com - detailed international data\n5. UMTRI (U-Michigan Transportation Research) - vehicle size trend reports\n6. Manufacturer media centers - Ford, Toyota, GM archives\n\nSales Data:\n7. GoodCarBadCar.net - historical sales by model\n8. Carsalesbase.com - US sales data\n9. Manufacturer annual reports\n\nDATA ORGANIZATION:\nCreate spreadsheet with tabs:\n- Ford vehicles\n- Toyota vehicles\n- Chevrolet vehicles\n- Summary comparisons\n- Visualizations\n\nANALYSIS TO PRODUCE:\n□ Growth percentages (1990 vs 2024) by vehicle type\n□ Visual overlays showing size increases\n□ Weight-to-sales correlations\n□ Parking space implications (how many 1990 vehicles fit in 2024 space?)\n□ Cross-brand validation (do all show same trend?)\n□ Category creep (today's \"compact\" vs yesterday's \"full-size\")\n\nTIMELINE ESTIMATE:\n- 2-3 hours per vehicle comprehensive data collection\n- ~20-30 hours total for all 9 vehicles\n- Plus analysis and visualization time\n\nQUICK WIN - Ford Explorer (COMPLETED):\nGen 1 (1991): 184.5\"L × 70\"W × 67.5\"H, 4,015-4,292 lbs\nGen 6 (2024): 198.8\"L × 78.5\"W × 69.9\"H, 4,345-4,727 lbs\nGrowth: +14.3\"L (+7.8%), +8.5\"W (+12.1%), +2.4\"H, +330-710 lbs\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n1. Start with best-sellers (F-150, Camry, RAV4) - most documented\n2. Create data collection template\n3. Build one complete example to establish pattern\n4. Replicate for remaining vehicles"
